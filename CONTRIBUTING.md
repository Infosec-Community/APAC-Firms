Contributing
=============

ü•≥ First off, thanks heaps for taking the time to contribute! üëç
We love your pull requests! Your contributions are essential in keeping this community resource great. We simply cannot do this alone and without your help. So a huge THANK YOU! ü§ó


## Getting Started
Contributing is simple.

1)  Login with a GitHub account
2)  Fork this repository on your GitHub account
3)  Clone the repository to your development machine.
4)  Following the formatting established, üõ† make your changes.
    - For content updates and additions, simply follow the existing formatting, and go right ahead.

    - For more significant changes potentially such as reformatting/overhauls etc, please open an Issue ticket descibing your intent before making any changes. We want to avoid merge/integration hell üòâ
5)  Make sure that you've included all the updates since you last `git clone`, and resolve any exiting conflicts. Add your name/handle to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` (if you want).

6)  Create a Pull Request to submit your changes. Here's a good guide from [Digtital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/hacktoberfest-how-to-submit-your-first-pull-request-on-github#creating-a-pull-request) that shows you how to do so.

Once you've done that, at this point, you can check this repository's `Pull Requests` tab to see your contribution. Now you're waiting on us (the maintainers). We like to at least comment on Pull Requests within about three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

If you don't hear from us within 5 business days, please reach out to the mantainers on Twitter. You can find us on the `README.md`.
